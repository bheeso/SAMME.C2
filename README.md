# SAMME.C2
This project provides the source code for the SAMME.C2 algorithm, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of two distinct algorithms:
- SAMME: This algorithm is an AdaBoost variant designed for multi-class classification.
- Cost-sensitive learning, as seen in Ada.C2.
  
SAMME.C2 leverages the power of both SAMME and cost-sensitive learning to enhance its effectiveness in various classification tasks.
