# SAMME.C2
This project provides the source code for the SAMME.C2 algorithm, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of two distinct algorithms:
- SAMME: This algorithm is an AdaBoost variant designed for multi-class classification.
- Cost-sensitive learning, as seen in Ada.C2.
  
SAMME.C2 leverages the power of both SAMME and cost-sensitive learning to enhance its effectiveness in various classification tasks.

		Calculate weight $\alpha_t = \log\!\Big(\dfrac{1-\epsilon_t}{\epsilon_t}\Big) + \log(K-1)$ \;
		
		Update sample weights $D_{t+1}(i) = \dfrac{C(y_i) \, D_t(i) \exp(-\alpha_t I(y_i = h_t(\bm{x}_i)))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} C(y_j) \, D_t(j) \exp(-\alpha_t I(y_j = h_t(\bm{x}_j)))}$ \;
